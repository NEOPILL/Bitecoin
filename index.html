      <h1>Money is broken.<br><span class="accent">Let’s fix it.</span></h1>

      <p>
        Bitecoin is a spendable, everyday-use currency built on modern rails.
        No bank manager. No business hours. Your money.
        A true crypto currency for the people with no restraints.
      </p>

      <p>Bitcoin solved trust.</p>
      <p>Ethereum solved computation.</p>
      <p>Solana solved throughput.</p>

      <p class="bold">
        No one solved money.<br>
        Money you spend. Money you use.<br>
        Money that fits in a normal life.<br>
        No questions about what you intend to do with your money.
      </p>

      <p class="closer">
        If banks want to hold our money hostage, let's move the goal posts.<br>
        They want an all-digital currency. Let’s use our own.
